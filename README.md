Composite Experiments on Database System.
# A brief description
In this project I created a university data base which is named (HOSSAIN
UNIVERSITY) the data base have 8 tables, 6 tables can be clearly seen from the E-R
diagram (Class,Student, Teacher, Major, Course, Section) while the remaining 2
tables (mark, teach) are created from N-N relationship between 2 tables, I ignored the
total participant for some tables in the diagram for the sake of simplicity. Of course
after creating the tables, data had been inserted to them using the easiest way however
I am quite familiar with using the “insert into table “command, but given the number
of tables and data that have to be filled, I filled the tables directly using the table
options in the SQL management studio, but the rest of the project will be finished
using only SQL commands.
